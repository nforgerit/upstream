* Jeez! Yet another PHP-based CMS
- primarily for my own purposes
- for educational curiosity
- as a reference of my e1337-skill0rz
- low requirements on the server: PHP5 is sufficient
- put away bureaucracy: GOOD naming instead of speaking naming; you deserve the right to shoot yourself into your own feet;
- important (thus often used) things should be global and shortly
  accessible:
  - class loader
  - configuration holder
- some nice tools used: Dep.Inj., TDD, Routes, Modularization, Factories  
- almost no backend for administration (it's a plus!): interact via REST
- send me a postcard if you use it and like it. if not, go away and
  better use the good leviathan TYPO3. 
- cli-based rapid development tool
- test-driven developed & highly covered 
- nice integration possibilities with FLOW3, Doctrine2 and ZF
* The Framework's Modules

- Module-specific configuration
